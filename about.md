I'm a Research Fellow at the University of Exeter working on the [CHANSE](https://www.researchgate.net/project/CHANSE-Coupled-Human-And-Natural-Systems-Environment-for-water-management-under-uncertainty-in-the-Indo-Gangetic-Plain) project.

The geographic focus of my research so far is northern India. the hydrology and water resources of northern India. For my PhD at Imperial College London I researched the impact of land use change on regional climate and water resources. I've helped to develop a regional glacier model for the tropical Andes... I support efforts to make science more open, especially making code and data freely available alongside the published results... Perhaps as a result of working mainly in data scarce regions, I'm interested in alternative data collection methods...
